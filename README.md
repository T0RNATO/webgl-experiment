Just me messing around with WebGL.

I went through [the MDN tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial) and then started playing around with it.

If for some reason you want to run it locally, `git clone`, then `npm install`, then `npm run dev` and follow the link in the terminal.
